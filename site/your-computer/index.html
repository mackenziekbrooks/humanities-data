<h2 id="do-you-really-know-your-computer">Do you really know your computer?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-really-know-your-computer" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>For many of us, computers are a means to an end, a tool for a job. We use our computers to write papers, send email, talk to our friends and family, watch Netflix, or maybe play a game. Maybe you use your computer to make art, do science, or analyze statistics. Most likely, you have a preference for a PC or a Mac, even if the only reason you can articulate is the way it looks. </p>
<p>But how well do you really know your computer? Do you know what operating system it runs? Which version of that operating system? When was the last time you updated it? Have you ever upgraded your hardware? Do you even know which pieces of your computer are the hardware? As an exercise, see if you can find the name and version of your operating system. What other information can you find out? </p>
<p>For a device as ubiquitous as the computer, most of us don't know a lot about how they work. On the one hand, that's great! Why should you have to learn the intricacies of bits, bytes, circuits, and microprocessors to do something basic like write an email? On the other hand, what if you want to use the power of your computer to count words, make a map, or analyze a network? When it comes to working with data, having a deeper understanding of what your computer can do can be to your advantage. Not everything can be done in the browser. After all, computers started their life as counting machines. If you want to work with large sets of data in an efficient manner, ask a computer to do what it is best at: count things, find patterns, or carry out a series of operations. That is not to say computers can do all the work! Humans have their own part to play. Someone has to give the instructions, write the programs, make connections, or see the larger context of the computer's work. In this section, we'll learn about one specific way to give instructions to your computer: the command line. </p>
<h2 id="command-line">Command Line<a class="headerlink" href="#command-line" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Most of us interact with our computers or phones through highly visual interfaces. We know what button to press because of the stylized image representing it. We understand what it means when a website has a blue "f" or when a friend sends a thumbs-up emoji. Your computer, regardless of operating system, wants to interact with you via visual cues. We call these Graphical User Interfaces aka GUI (pronounced gooey). </p>
<p>But there's another way. You can interact with your computer entirely via text commands through something called a Command Line Interface or CLI. When you see a hacker typing green text into a black box in a movie, they're using the command line. But the command line isn't just for hacking. Not only can you perform a number of different actions on your computer, many pieces of software can only be used through the command line. You can use the command line to create, move, or copy files. You can convert images or find and replace. You can run complex programming languages, or just write a simple script to automate a repetitive task. There are many tools for working with data that require you to use the command line. </p>
<p>Just like HTML and CSS, you do not have to memorize every command. There are plenty of sites to remind you of the commands or that provide existing scripts to help with a task. </p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>For Mac users: 
* Search and open (<code>Command + Space</code>) for an app called Terminal. A white box should appear. 
* You should see some information about you computer, then your name, then a dollar sign. It could look like this <code>38371-Lib-Brooks:~ mackenzie$</code>. 
* Typing in this program is a little different than typing in a document. You cannot use your mouse to click into text and change what is written. Pretend you're working at an old school computer where there is no mouse. If you want to change what you've written, use the arrow keys or backspace to navigate. 
* Type in the letters <code>pwd</code>. No spaces, no capitalization. Hit enter. This command stands for "print working directory" and tell us where we are in the file structure. Confused yet? Scroll down to the next section for more context.</p>
<p>For Windows users: 
* Search/open a program called <code>cmd.exe</code> or Powershell. </p>
<p>If you're using a Chromebook, or another device, ...</p>
<p>Once you have the window open, you should </p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#syntax" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><code>$ command parameters -flag</code></p>
<pre><code>```
$ says start after me
command = what to do
parameters = how to do it
flag = use this option
```

<p>There are a lot of resources for learning the command line. We'll be using <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/appendixa.html">The Command Line Crash Course</a> in this class. </p>
<p>Programming Historian offers <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash">Intro to the Bash Command Line</a> and <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-powershell">Intro to Powershell</a>.</p>
<p>Scholars' Lab has a great <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/bash/">tutorial</a>. </p>
