What is data again? Data structures Tabular data Relational data Data serialization Textual data Data types Clean, tidy, and normal data Data cleaning tools and methods Open Refine Excel Regular Expressions Data modeling Extending your data Linked data Activities Activity 1 Activity 2 Activity 3 Readings Resources What is data again? # In the last section, we got as far as defining data as \"a value assigned to a thing.\" While that remains true, let's dig a little deeper. If we put on our humanities hat, we start to see data little more complexly. In her article, \" Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display ,\" Johanna Drucker posits the following about data: \"To overturn the assumptions that structure conventions acquired from other domains requires that we re-examine the intellectual foundations of digital humanities, putting techniques of graphical display on a foundation that is humanistic at its base. This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta. Differences in the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between constructivist and realist approaches clear. Capta is \u201ctaken\u201d actively while data is assumed to be a \u201cgiven\u201d able to be recorded and observed. From this distinction, a world of differences arises. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural representation of pre-existing fact.\" This is a long quote, but the concept of \"capta\" is a useful one. Even if we don't go around calling everything \"capta\" instead of \"data,\" it is a helpful reminder that data is constructed, especially but not only in the humanities. Every single piece of data represents a decision that someone made. The number of rows and columns, the labels, the format, the extent or granularity of the values and the things - these are all choices. They are choices you should consider when creating a data set from scratch or when you use someone else's data. In the rest of this section, we will dig into the details of putting together a data set. Data structures # Data can exist in many different forms. You might imagine a \"spreadsheet\" when thinking about data, but in truth, there are a number of other ways to express and structure your data. Tabular data # This is our common spreadsheet data structure. Data fits into a table, in which each row represents a thing. Each column is a different field or modifier of that thing. The values reside in each individual cell. In the following table, each row represents one pet. PetID Name Animal Breed Pet1 Huxley Cat Tabby Pet2 Harper Dog Flat Coat Retriever Pet3 Hobbes Dog Hound If you're new to making spreadsheets, it can be tempting to swamp the rows and columns so that each column represents a thing. It can also be tempting to include empty cells as spaces or use visual cues like color or bold/italics to set apart text. These methods will certainly help you as a human, but it's important to keep in mind that most of the software that might process your data will not be able to understand these visual cues. Most of the software that will process your data, whether it's for visualization or analysis, will want to see your data in a format known as CSV or Comma Separated Value. This format strips away any visual formatting and stores each cell in plain text, separated by a comma. So the above table about pets, would look like this: PetID,Name,Animal,Breed, Pet1,Huxley,Cat,Tabby, Pet2,Harper,Dog,Flat Coat Retriever, Pet3,Hobbes,Dog,Hound The CSV format reduces file size, simplifies the content, and keeps the file from being dependent on proprietary software like Excel. Fortunately, you don't have to construct your data with commas. Applications like Excel or Google Sheets will let you save or export your file with the file extension .csv . It's a good habit to get into when working with data. You might also see .tsv for tab separated values. Relational data # For some projects, a single table quickly becomes insufficient. Perhaps your project requires collecting data about a group of people, the houses they live in, the land they occupy, etc. It might be time to look into using a database to store all that data. A database works on a relational model - you might have multiple tables, but they are connected through shared values or \"keys.\" Using a database allows you to gather data about many different things, things that may require different fields to describe them. So my table of people may contain a column to note which house they live in, but I can rely on a totally separate table to list all the details about the house itself. This keeps me from cluttering my people table with information that isn't relevant to the main thing my row is about. Often, this is done with an ID number rather than the full title. A second advantage of a database is the ability to ask questions of your data. To continue the example from above, I can now ask questions like: How many people live in houses that are yellow? Of the houses on this block, which ones are occupied by people with children? These questions require that I filter based on certain values within each distinct data table and combine them into a new set. Typically, questions like this are asked with a language called SQL or Structure Query Language (yes, another language with its own syntax!). The basic syntax of SQL looks like this: SELECT column_name,column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value; And a more specific example might look like this. In this example, the asterisk means everything, so I'm asking for all fields about the cats. SELECT * FROM pets WHERE animal='cat'; Asking these types of questions of data is often what humanities scholars are after when they decide to build a database. However, designing a database and the interface that goes along with it is a huge endeavor, and often requires the help of a professional database designer. Databases can be built in many different types of software (you might encounter names like MySQL or PostgreSQL), but web-based databases will need to be installed on a server, not just your own computer. If you're undertaking a big project, it's important to assess your resources for creating a database. Fortunately, there are an increasing number of options for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data without database software. Creating well-structured data ensures that your data can be imported into these tools with ease. Data serialization # Data serialization is the process by which taken is transformed into another format that can be transferred or stored, then reconstituted. Often, this is necessary so that a programming language or software application can more easily and quickly do something with the data. With serialization comes a few different types of data structures that are important to know. JSON , or JavaScript Objection Notation, is a way to structure data based on attribute-value pairs and curly brackets. Just like CSV, if you're working with a JSON file, it will have the file extension .json . You probably won't end up writing JSON from scratch, but you might have to convert your data to JSON for a certain application. And FYI, JSON is not only used with JavaScript. Here's an example. Notice the level of structure introduced with the Address line. There are four fields and values (you might see this called an array) that modify one field, Address. { \"PetID\": \"Pet1\", \"Name\": \"Huxley\", \"Animal\": true, \"Breed\": \"Tabby\", \"Address\": { \"streetAddress\": \"555 5th St.\", \"city\": \"The Couch\", \"state\": \"Living Room\", \"postalCode\": \"55555\" }, } XML or Extensible Markup Language is more than just a serialized data format, it's also a markup language (like HTML). XML has been around a long time, so you will see it referenced in many Digital Humanities projects. XML is highly structured, but allows the user to define the tags that are used. A common application in humanities projects is the Text Encoding Initiative or TEI. TEI is used to markup humanities texts, just like you would markup a website, but instead you use tags like <l> for line and <epigraph> for epigraph. TEI allows you to do things like build a website for testing your ability to read rhyme and meter in poetry. It is a foundational practice in DH - the process by which a human interprets a text and encodes the meaning in a way that the computer can understand. Example: <lg rhyme=\"ABCCBBA\"> <l>The sunlight on the <rhyme label=\"A\">garden</rhyme> </l> <l> <rhyme label=\"A\">Harden</rhyme>s and grows <rhyme label=\"B\">cold</rhyme>,</l> <l>We cannot cage the <rhyme label=\"C\">minute</rhyme> </l> <l>Wi<rhyme label=\"C\">thin it</rhyme>s nets of <rhyme label=\"B\">gold</rhyme> </l> <l>When all is <rhyme label=\"B\">told</rhyme> </l> <l>We cannot beg for <rhyme label=\"A\">pardon</rhyme>.</l> </lg> Textual data # Not all data has needs to exist in a spreadsheet. In the humanities, we read a lot! We need a way to store textual data, such as a whole book, set of documents, or a century of newspaper articles. A later section will cover the ins and outs of text analysis, but if you're looking to analyze a corpus (another word for collection of texts) of some kind, you need to structure it in some way. The common method for storing textual data is in a plain text format or with the file extension .txt . Plain text files are just that - documents without the formatting that comes from MS Word or other word processing applications. Just like our HTML documents or our CSV files, a text document simplifies the content for the computer. When we're counting the number of times Jane Austen used the word \"honor\" or looking for the use of the word \"evolution\" over time , we are concerned with the words in the text, not the way the text looks. Plain text format reduces file size to improve processing time and transfer of data. You'll probably want to use a text editor for viewing these files, just like we did when writing HTML. Depending on what you're doing, you will also want to pay attention to the name and organization of your text files. If you noticed in the Voyant instance with Jane Austen, the title of each text was preceded by the year of publication. This file naming strategy makes it easy to sort the texts by their publication date. It's just something to pay attention to when constructing your corpus. If you do care about what the text looks like, you might want to look for ways to analyze TEI documents, not just plain text. Text Encoding allows you to add details about the appearance of the text, perhaps there's another hand writing in the margins or use of italics or white space in poetry. Data types # Once you have settled on the right structure for your data, you need to consider the data types you will use in each field. Most programming languages accept the following: Data Type Example Strings or characters, often surrounded by quote marks \"String!\" Integer 4 Decimal 4.10 Boolean, another way to say true/false or yes/no TRUE Date, usually formatted as YYYY-MM-DD 2019-10-20 Time, usually formatted as HH:MM:SS 10:17:26 There are a few others data types, but these will be most relevant in humanities projects. You will find that Excel loves to chew up and spit out dates unless you standardize formatting in this way. Clean, tidy, and normal data # As you start to work with data, you'll likely encounter these terms \"clean, tidy, normal,\" used as adjectives and verbs. What do they all mean? How do you know when your data is clean and tidy? Maybe your data is just the black sheep of the family! Cleaning data usually refers to the process of correcting the contents of your dataset. Typos, mistakes, new information can all be cleaned up after the data entry process is complete. You don't have to read every cell one by one, there are a number of tools and methods. Often, visualization your data is a great way to find issues you didn't know you had. Tidy data comes from the community around R, the programming language. Tidy data is well-structured, or as Hadley Wickham puts it, \"Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.\" Sounds familiar, right? Normalized data is a database term. It refers to the process of structuring your tables to reduce redundancy and complexity. Normalized data should be easier for both humans and computers to understand. Before we get to tools and methods for straightening up your data, let's take a moment for a pep talk. Data is messy! Whether you created it yourself or are using someone else's data, chances are, something will be wrong with it! The data entry process can be long, and it's easy to change your habits or come upon a better way to record things. This is normal. To set yourself up for success, document your decisions as you make them. It is easy to absorbed in your work, make a decision, then put your work down and forget about the decision a week later. Keeping a log of changes will also help anyone else who might be contributing. Be consistent! If you want to change a \"T\" to \"True,\" it's easy to find and replace. It's not as easy to go through a mix of values. Finally, remember what the computer is for. It can be tempting to embark on a cleanup project by hand, instead of looking for automated ways to correct your data. Knowing when to cleanup by hand or when to spend the time figuring out how to automate a task is a mark of experience. You won't get it right every time. But it is worthwhile to consider if something can be done in an automated way. Find and replace, when coupled with regular expressions, can be pretty powerful. It can feel like a waste to spend time automating a task when you could just do it, but the skills you learn in the process are valuable and can be applied on future tasks. Data cleaning tools and methods # Open Refine # I try to avoid calling technology magic, but Open Refine is magic. It takes some getting used to, but it is indeed a \"powerful tool for working with messy data.\" When you install and run Open Refine, it launches a local server on computer so you interact with the application in your browser. However, just because it's in your browser does not mean it's connected to the internet. Once you've loaded your data, you use the drop down arrows to access various tools for modifying your data. This is not a tool for scrolling through your data, it's used for targeted approaches to specific issues. As an example, you can use the \"cluster and edit\" feature to find similar cells and standardize their contents. The \"text facet\" feature shows how many cells share the same value. When you sort by alphabetical order, it is really easy to see if you have entered the same name in two different ways. There are a number of tutorials on the documentation page . Try this one, \" Cleaning Data with OpenRefine \" from the Programming Historian. Excel # Before you get to specialized tools like Open Refine, you can always use Excel or Google Sheets to check your work. Filter - use the filter feature to assess the contents of a single column. You can easily see if a cell is empty or has an incorrect entry. Data Validation - allows you to control what is entered into a cell. You can identify a list of options or select a specific data type. Formulas - there are plenty of spreadsheet formulas designed to work with strings of text. Use the help pages and a search engine to look for examples. There are multiple methods for splitting columns if you need to separate first and last names, or copy over the first half of a string. Regular Expressions # Regular expressions are a method for matching patterns in text. It's a set of special characters that when used together in certain contexts helps you find and replace in powerful ways. For example, you could find all the phone numbers in a text by looking for the pattern (###) ###-#### or all forms of \"women\" by using the pattern \"wom.n\" to replace the fourth character. Regular expressions are awesome, but they can get frustrating quickly. Don't be overwhelmed by the complex patterns you encounter in tutorials. Even the basics can come in handy when cleaning data. Plus, there are a lot of resources out there for helping you use them effectively. Regular Expressions 101 Beginning with Regular Expressions Cleaning OCR'd text with regular expressions Data modeling # Whether you are aware of it or not, data modeling is part of the data creation process. All of the decisions that you might make about your data, the format, the data types, the fields, help to form a model of your data. Data modeling is a process that has been part of humanities work for a long time, just not by that name. When we attempt to organize the world through means like time periods, genres, or lists of names (prosopographies) or places (gazeteers), we are creating models that may or may not line up with reality. A model is an abstraction of an object. It can be a window into our disciplinary or personal values. The tools you choose to use will also contribute to the shape of your data model, as they can limit what and how you record your data. There is a lot more to be said about data models and their role in humanities data work. There are different types of models and various ways to approach their creation and use. Data modeling has precise meanings within other disciplines, such as computer science. If you want to learn more, start with \" Data Modeling in a Digital Humanities Context \" by Julia Flanders and Fotis Jannidis. But for now, let's return to that Miriam Posner article, \" Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction .\" \"When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results. This is not how humanists think of the material they work with.\" Data modeling is important precisely because it forces humanities scholars to clearly identify their goals and parameters. If you start a project without an initial idea of your data model, you could lose years sifting through archival material or transcribing handwritten notes. Or as Scott Weingart writes , \"Humanistic data are almost by definition uncertain, open to interpretation, flexible, and not easily definable.\" To many humanities scholars, articulating a detailed data model can feel like a reduction of their subject. Or perhaps they're eager to dive into material, and then end up with a mess of a spreadsheet, unsure how to turn it into anything usable. It's okay if your data model grows and changes over time, but it should be recognized as a formal step in the process. What does a data model look like? It depends on your project, but at its most basic, it could be a list of the fields in your spreadsheet, with a description of the values and their format. A data model for the Pets example above could be: PetID: a generic ID for each pet, max 6 alphanumeric characters Name: the given name of the pet. Animal: specify the type of animal from a controlled list: Dog, Cat, Bird, Gecko Breed: specify the breed of pet from a controlled vocabulary of Official Animal Breeds. You might also want to indicate the extent of this list of pets. Who owns them? What the connection between them? Where did this information come from? Obviously, this is not an ambitious data project as it stands, but we can imagine some other categories to include: age, location, weight, health, favorite toy, favorite nap spot, etc. When I decide to add another field or change how I enter a value, I must update my data model to reflect these changes. Perhaps I realize halfway through my data collection that I should be using the scientific classification for animals, rather than a generic \"dog\" and \"cat.\" If I had thought about my data model, I might have come to this decision at the beginning of my project. Think of data modeling as a favor to yourself and to anyone else who might encounter your data and wonder about your decisions. Extending your data # Once you have a good sense of how your data is going to look, it is worth considering options for extending your data. Do not assume you have to start from scratch. There are many other organizations and projects out there dedicated to creating data that can be used by others. Pelagios can help you describe historical places. PeriodO can help you describe time. Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus contains thousands of terms for describing art and material culture. And of course, libraries have long been in the business of organizing and sharing their data. Linked data # One way of extending your data is through the use of something called \"linked data.\" Linked data is a method for structuring data so that it can be connected and linked to other data sets. You might also see this called the \"Semantic Web.\" One way to create linked data is through the use of URIs or Uniform Resource Identifiers. The idea is that every thing in your data should be given a unique identifier. When you or anyone else references that thing, you use the identifier to indicate that we are talking about the same thing. The value of URIs becomes clear in any project with people. It's common for people to share the same names - giving them a unique ID number eliminates confusion and unites variant forms of the same name. But URIs are not just ID numbers, the should be HTTP URIs, meaning they look like a URL. Here's one for Audre Lorde: https://viaf.org/viaf/61565157/. The other principle of linked data is the not only are the things given unique identifiers, so are the relationships between those things. We can standardize those connections and use URIs to express them. When we connect these URIs together, we start to see our data in a new way: the graph. Source: RDF Primer We haven't talked about RDF yet, but we can define it using terms we have just learned. RDF , or Resource Description Framework, is a data model for describing resources. It structures data through the use of triples or subject-predicate-object expressions, such as the ones we see in the image above.

If you're overwhelmed, tuck them in your pocket for later. This is a window into advanced work with humanities data. It's good to know it exists, but it's okay if you're not ready for it yet. Activities # Activity 1 # In this activity, we'll assess a dataset according to the criteria we've learned about in this section. Download the LexingtonCemetery.csv file. Open in Excel. Since this dataset is a CSV file, you may need to follow these instructions: Navigate to the Data tab in Excel. Select \"From Text\" then find your file. A wizard should pop up to walk you through the import process. It should automatically detect the commas, but if it doesn't, you will need to check the box to indicate that this file is delimited by commas. The data preview should each distinct column of data, rather than everything running together. What do you see? Take some time to explore this data by scrolling around. Get a sense of what is here and what might be missing. It might help to take a look at the cemetery website or to read this press release . In a separate document, start to draft a data model for this spreadsheet as you encounter it. Make note of the data types and formats, as well as suggestions for improvement. Activity 2 # Let's take Open Refine for a spin in order to clean up this data set. Download Open Refine and run the program. Follow the installation instruction if you get stuck. It should open a new tab in your browser with the address http://127.0.0.1:3333/ . This address is local to your computer. Import the LexingtonCemetery.csv file. You will see a page of import options, you should be able to accept the defaults. Spend some time clicking on all the options in Open Refine to see what happens. Set a timer and spend 10-15 minutes playing around with the software before you turn to documentation or instructions. What can you learn in this time? If things get too messy, you can always exit out and start over. Now answer these questions: What do the \"Text Facet\" or \"Numeric Facet\" features reveal about this data? Are there outliers that need investigation? Are there columns that should be split or joined? How would you do this in Open Refine (or Excel?) What columns would be best served by the \"cluster and edit\" feature? Why? Which columns need to be modified for consistency? Activity 3 # Time to take a little step back from this data set and think about its potential. Answer the following questions: What cleanup work does this data need to be more usable? Do you need to adjust your data model? How might you extend this data set? What research questions does it inspire? Do you need to conduct more research to learn about the people in this data set? How will you go about it? What (or who?) might be missing from this data set? We have yet to learn about the ins and outs of methods of analyzing data, but what would you want to do with this data? Bonus: visit the cemetery! How does experiencing it in person change your view of the data? Does everything match up? Do you observe other things that should be in this data?

If we put on our humanities hat, we start to see data little more complexly. In her article, \" Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display ,\" Johanna Drucker posits the following about data: \"To overturn the assumptions that structure conventions acquired from other domains requires that we re-examine the intellectual foundations of digital humanities, putting techniques of graphical display on a foundation that is humanistic at its base. This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta. Differences in the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between constructivist and realist approaches clear. Capta is \u201ctaken\u201d actively while data is assumed to be a \u201cgiven\u201d able to be recorded and observed. From this distinction, a world of differences arises. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural representation of pre-existing fact.\" This is a long quote, but the concept of \"capta\" is a useful one. Even if we don't go around calling everything \"capta\" instead of \"data,\" it is a helpful reminder that data is constructed, especially but not only in the humanities. Every single piece of data represents a decision that someone made. The number of rows and columns, the labels, the format, the extent or granularity of the values and the things - these are all choices. They are choices you should consider when creating a data set from scratch or when you use someone else's data. In the rest of this section, we will dig into the details of putting together a data set.","title":"What is data again?"},{"location":"data/#data-structures","text":"Data can exist in many different forms. You might imagine a \"spreadsheet\" when thinking about data, but in truth, there are a number of other ways to express and structure your data.","title":"Data structures"},{"location":"data/#tabular-data","text":"This is our common spreadsheet data structure. Data fits into a table, in which each row represents a thing. Each column is a different field or modifier of that thing. The values reside in each individual cell. In the following table, each row represents one pet. PetID Name Animal Breed Pet1 Huxley Cat Tabby Pet2 Harper Dog Flat Coat Retriever Pet3 Hobbes Dog Hound If you're new to making spreadsheets, it can be tempting to swamp the rows and columns so that each column represents a thing. It can also be tempting to include empty cells as spaces or use visual cues like color or bold/italics to set apart text. These methods will certainly help you as a human, but it's important to keep in mind that most of the software that might process your data will not be able to understand these visual cues. Most of the software that will process your data, whether it's for visualization or analysis, will want to see your data in a format known as CSV or Comma Separated Value. This format strips away any visual formatting and stores each cell in plain text, separated by a comma. So the above table about pets, would look like this: PetID,Name,Animal,Breed, Pet1,Huxley,Cat,Tabby, Pet2,Harper,Dog,Flat Coat Retriever, Pet3,Hobbes,Dog,Hound The CSV format reduces file size, simplifies the content, and keeps the file from being dependent on proprietary software like Excel. Fortunately, you don't have to construct your data with commas. Applications like Excel or Google Sheets will let you save or export your file with the file extension .csv . It's a good habit to get into when working with data. You might also see .tsv for tab separated values.","title":"Tabular data"},{"location":"data/#relational-data","text":"For some projects, a single table quickly becomes insufficient. Perhaps your project requires collecting data about a group of people, the houses they live in, the land they occupy, etc. It might be time to look into using a database to store all that data. A database works on a relational model - you might have multiple tables, but they are connected through shared values or \"keys.\" Using a database allows you to gather data about many different things, things that may require different fields to describe them. So my table of people may contain a column to note which house they live in, but I can rely on a totally separate table to list all the details about the house itself. This keeps me from cluttering my people table with information that isn't relevant to the main thing my row is about. Often, this is done with an ID number rather than the full title. A second advantage of a database is the ability to ask questions of your data. To continue the example from above, I can now ask questions like: How many people live in houses that are yellow? Of the houses on this block, which ones are occupied by people with children? These questions require that I filter based on certain values within each distinct data table and combine them into a new set. Typically, questions like this are asked with a language called SQL or Structure Query Language (yes, another language with its own syntax!). The basic syntax of SQL looks like this: SELECT column_name,column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value; And a more specific example might look like this. In this example, the asterisk means everything, so I'm asking for all fields about the cats. SELECT * FROM pets WHERE animal='cat'; Asking these types of questions of data is often what humanities scholars are after when they decide to build a database. However, designing a database and the interface that goes along with it is a huge endeavor, and often requires the help of a professional database designer. Databases can be built in many different types of software (you might encounter names like MySQL or PostgreSQL), but web-based databases will need to be installed on a server, not just your own computer. If you're undertaking a big project, it's important to assess your resources for creating a database. Fortunately, there are an increasing number of options for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data without database software. Creating well-structured data ensures that your data can be imported into these tools with ease.","title":"Relational data"},{"location":"data/#data-serialization","text":"Data serialization is the process by which taken is transformed into another format that can be transferred or stored, then reconstituted. Often, this is necessary so that a programming language or software application can more easily and quickly do something with the data. With serialization comes a few different types of data structures that are important to know. JSON , or JavaScript Objection Notation, is a way to structure data based on attribute-value pairs and curly brackets. Just like CSV, if you're working with a JSON file, it will have the file extension .json . You probably won't end up writing JSON from scratch, but you might have to convert your data to JSON for a certain application. And FYI, JSON is not only used with JavaScript. Here's an example. Notice the level of structure introduced with the Address line. There are four fields and values (you might see this called an array) that modify one field, Address. { \"PetID\": \"Pet1\", \"Name\": \"Huxley\", \"Animal\": true, \"Breed\": \"Tabby\", \"Address\": { \"streetAddress\": \"555 5th St.\", \"city\": \"The Couch\", \"state\": \"Living Room\", \"postalCode\": \"55555\" }, } XML or Extensible Markup Language is more than just a serialized data format, it's also a markup language (like HTML). XML has been around a long time, so you will see it referenced in many Digital Humanities projects. XML is highly structured, but allows the user to define the tags that are used. A common application in humanities projects is the Text Encoding Initiative or TEI. TEI is used to markup humanities texts, just like you would markup a website, but instead you use tags like <l> for line and <epigraph> for epigraph. TEI allows you to do things like build a website for testing your ability to read rhyme and meter in poetry. It is a foundational practice in DH - the process by which a human interprets a text and encodes the meaning in a way that the computer can understand. Example: <lg rhyme=\"ABCCBBA\"> <l>The sunlight on the <rhyme label=\"A\">garden</rhyme> </l> <l> <rhyme label=\"A\">Harden</rhyme>s and grows <rhyme label=\"B\">cold</rhyme>,</l> <l>We cannot cage the <rhyme label=\"C\">minute</rhyme> </l> <l>Wi<rhyme label=\"C\">thin it</rhyme>s nets of <rhyme label=\"B\">gold</rhyme> </l> <l>When all is <rhyme label=\"B\">told</rhyme> </l> <l>We cannot beg for <rhyme label=\"A\">pardon</rhyme>.</l> </lg>","title":"Data serialization"},{"location":"data/#textual-data","text":"Not all data has needs to exist in a spreadsheet. In the humanities, we read a lot! We need a way to store textual data, such as a whole book, set of documents, or a century of newspaper articles. A later section will cover the ins and outs of text analysis, but if you're looking to analyze a corpus (another word for collection of texts) of some kind, you need to structure it in some way. The common method for storing textual data is in a plain text format or with the file extension .txt . Plain text files are just that - documents without the formatting that comes from MS Word or other word processing applications. Just like our HTML documents or our CSV files, a text document simplifies the content for the computer. When we're counting the number of times Jane Austen used the word \"honor\" or looking for the use of the word \"evolution\" over time , we are concerned with the words in the text, not the way the text looks. Plain text format reduces file size to improve processing time and transfer of data. You'll probably want to use a text editor for viewing these files, just like we did when writing HTML. Depending on what you're doing, you will also want to pay attention to the name and organization of your text files. If you noticed in the Voyant instance with Jane Austen, the title of each text was preceded by the year of publication. This file naming strategy makes it easy to sort the texts by their publication date. It's just something to pay attention to when constructing your corpus. If you do care about what the text looks like, you might want to look for ways to analyze TEI documents, not just plain text. Text Encoding allows you to add details about the appearance of the text, perhaps there's another hand writing in the margins or use of italics or white space in poetry.","title":"Textual data"},{"location":"data/#data-types","text":"Once you have settled on the right structure for your data, you need to consider the data types you will use in each field. Most programming languages accept the following: Data Type Example Strings or characters, often surrounded by quote marks \"String!\" Integer 4 Decimal 4.10 Boolean, another way to say true/false or yes/no TRUE Date, usually formatted as YYYY-MM-DD 2019-10-20 Time, usually formatted as HH:MM:SS 10:17:26 There are a few others data types, but these will be most relevant in humanities projects. You will find that Excel loves to chew up and spit out dates unless you standardize formatting in this way.","title":"Data types"},{"location":"data/#clean-tidy-and-normal-data","text":"As you start to work with data, you'll likely encounter these terms \"clean, tidy, normal,\" used as adjectives and verbs. What do they all mean? How do you know when your data is clean and tidy? Maybe your data is just the black sheep of the family! Cleaning data usually refers to the process of correcting the contents of your dataset. Typos, mistakes, new information can all be cleaned up after the data entry process is complete. You don't have to read every cell one by one, there are a number of tools and methods. Often, visualization your data is a great way to find issues you didn't know you had. Tidy data comes from the community around R, the programming language. Tidy data is well-structured, or as Hadley Wickham puts it, \"Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.\" Sounds familiar, right? Normalized data is a database term. It refers to the process of structuring your tables to reduce redundancy and complexity. Normalized data should be easier for both humans and computers to understand. Before we get to tools and methods for straightening up your data, let's take a moment for a pep talk. Data is messy! Whether you created it yourself or are using someone else's data, chances are, something will be wrong with it! The data entry process can be long, and it's easy to change your habits or come upon a better way to record things. This is normal. To set yourself up for success, document your decisions as you make them. It is easy to absorbed in your work, make a decision, then put your work down and forget about the decision a week later. Keeping a log of changes will also help anyone else who might be contributing. Be consistent! If you want to change a \"T\" to \"True,\" it's easy to find and replace. It's not as easy to go through a mix of values. Finally, remember what the computer is for. It can be tempting to embark on a cleanup project by hand, instead of looking for automated ways to correct your data. Knowing when to cleanup by hand or when to spend the time figuring out how to automate a task is a mark of experience. You won't get it right every time. But it is worthwhile to consider if something can be done in an automated way. Find and replace, when coupled with regular expressions, can be pretty powerful. It can feel like a waste to spend time automating a task when you could just do it, but the skills you learn in the process are valuable and can be applied on future tasks.","title":"Clean, tidy, and normal data"},{"location":"data/#data-cleaning-tools-and-methods","text":"","title":"Data cleaning tools and methods"},{"location":"data/#open-refine","text":"I try to avoid calling technology magic, but Open Refine is magic.

However, just because it's in your browser does not mean it's connected to the internet. Once you've loaded your data, you use the drop down arrows to access various tools for modifying your data. This is not a tool for scrolling through your data, it's used for targeted approaches to specific issues. As an example, you can use the \"cluster and edit\" feature to find similar cells and standardize their contents. The \"text facet\" feature shows how many cells share the same value.

All of the decisions that you might make about your data, the format, the data types, the fields, help to form a model of your data. Data modeling is a process that has been part of humanities work for a long time, just not by that name. When we attempt to organize the world through means like time periods, genres, or lists of names (prosopographies) or places (gazeteers), we are creating models that may or may not line up with reality. A model is an abstraction of an object. It can be a window into our disciplinary or personal values. The tools you choose to use will also contribute to the shape of your data model, as they can limit what and how you record your data. There is a lot more to be said about data models and their role in humanities data work. There are different types of models and various ways to approach their creation and use. Data modeling has precise meanings within other disciplines, such as computer science. If you want to learn more, start with \" Data Modeling in a Digital Humanities Context \" by Julia Flanders and Fotis Jannidis. But for now, let's return to that Miriam Posner article, \" Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction .\" \"When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results. This is not how humanists think of the material they work with.\" Data modeling is important precisely because it forces humanities scholars to clearly identify their goals and parameters. If you start a project without an initial idea of your data model, you could lose years sifting through archival material or transcribing handwritten notes. Or as Scott Weingart writes , \"Humanistic data are almost by definition uncertain, open to interpretation, flexible, and not easily definable.\" To many humanities scholars, articulating a detailed data model can feel like a reduction of their subject. Or perhaps they're eager to dive into material, and then end up with a mess of a spreadsheet, unsure how to turn it into anything usable. It's okay if your data model grows and changes over time, but it should be recognized as a formal step in the process. What does a data model look like? It depends on your project, but at its most basic, it could be a list of the fields in your spreadsheet, with a description of the values and their format. A data model for the Pets example above could be: PetID: a generic ID for each pet, max 6 alphanumeric characters Name: the given name of the pet. Animal: specify the type of animal from a controlled list: Dog, Cat, Bird, Gecko Breed: specify the breed of pet from a controlled vocabulary of Official Animal Breeds. You might also want to indicate the extent of this list of pets. Who owns them? What the connection between them? Where did this information come from? Obviously, this is not an ambitious data project as it stands, but we can imagine some other categories to include: age, location, weight, health, favorite toy, favorite nap spot, etc. When I decide to add another field or change how I enter a value, I must update my data model to reflect these changes. Perhaps I realize halfway through my data collection that I should be using the scientific classification for animals, rather than a generic \"dog\" and \"cat.\" If I had thought about my data model, I might have come to this decision at the beginning of my project. Think of data modeling as a favor to yourself and to anyone else who might encounter your data and wonder about your decisions.","title":"Data modeling"},{"location":"data/#extending-your-data","text":"Once you have a good sense of how your data is going to look, it is worth considering options for extending your data. Do not assume you have to start from scratch. There are many other organizations and projects out there dedicated to creating data that can be used by others. Pelagios can help you describe historical places. PeriodO can help you describe time. Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus contains thousands of terms for describing art and material culture. And of course, libraries have long been in the business of organizing and sharing their data.","title":"Extending your data"},{"location":"data/#linked-data","text":"One way of extending your data is through the use of something called \"linked data.\" Linked data is a method for structuring data so that it can be connected and linked to other data sets. You might also see this called the \"Semantic Web.\" One way to create linked data is through the use of URIs or Uniform Resource Identifiers. The idea is that every thing in your data should be given a unique identifier. When you or anyone else references that thing, you use the identifier to indicate that we are talking about the same thing. The value of URIs becomes clear in any project with people. It's common for people to share the same names - giving them a unique ID number eliminates confusion and unites variant forms of the same name. But URIs are not just ID numbers, the should be HTTP URIs, meaning they look like a URL. Here's one for Audre Lorde: https://viaf.org/viaf/61565157/. The other principle of linked data is the not only are the things given unique identifiers, so are the relationships between those things. We can standardize those connections and use URIs to express them. When we connect these URIs together, we start to see our data in a new way: the graph. Source: RDF Primer We haven't talked about RDF yet, but we can define it using terms we have just learned. RDF , or Resource Description Framework, is a data model for describing resources. It structures data through the use of triples or subject-predicate-object expressions, such as the ones we see in the image above. RDF can be serialized in several ways, through formats like Turtle, JSON-LD, RDFa, and RDF-XML. Okay, that was a lot of acronyms, but you should recognize some.

Just kidding, it's not, but it can certainly seem that way. Maybe you're reading this on your phone in the middle of the lawn, or curled up in bed with your laptop. It's more than likely that you're using Wi-Fi or a cellular network and therefore have no physical connection to the Internet. It's understandable that it feels like magic sometimes! But in reality, the Internet is an immensely physical thing. Put simply, it is computers connected to other computers. The information (text or media and all forms in between) you send and receive travels through wires and fiber-optic cables in the ground and even under the ocean . These connected or \"networked\" computers talk to each other using their own languages or more precisely, specific protocols. For instance, every computer has an address, known as an IP (Internet Protocol) address, to help direct traffic to the right place. Another protocol that you use, even if you don't realize it, is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. Your browser uses HTTP to render websites. When you type in http://www.wlu.edu your browser sends out a request to the computer that can serve up all the files at that particular address. The \"server\" returns the files and your browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) renders them into a website. At its simplest, a website is just a folder full of files and images. Those files are full of code, which we'll learn about in the next section. Make sense? Here are a few videos that might help you visualize this great network of computers: What is the Internet? The Internet: Wires, Cables, and Wi-fi HTML # HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is one of the basic building blocks of the web. Every website you see is created using this language, from the most basic to most interactive. To prove it, go to your browser open up a new tab right now. Visit any website you like. Right click, or ctrl + click to open up an options menu. Select View Page Source . If you're using Safari, try pressing Command + Option + i . You should see a new window full of text surrounded by angle brackets. That's HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a set of tags, or elements , that adds structure to a document or page. When you write a document, you rely on style to indicate something about the text. You might put the title in a bigger font or break up paragraphs with tabs or new lines. Markup languages do this by adding tags around the content you wish to set apart. For example: <h1>This is a top level heading</h1> is HTML that tells the browser to 1) increase the size of the text, but more importantly 2) that this piece of text represents a major section of the document. Which pieces of text on this page are an <h1> ? Can you use the View Page Source trick to confirm? What are other tags that you might expect to exist? If you were to analyze a website, what are the major components? What are the familiar conventions of websites, regardless of the type? Some things that come to mind: menus or navigation <nav> , images <img src=\"kittens.jpg\"> , or even just your basic paragraph <p> . To give you a taste, a basic HTML document might look like this: <html> <head> <title>My Awesome Website</title> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome/h1> <p>This is a long paragraph about my cat.</p> </body> </html> As you can see, angle brackets surround each tag. The tags themselves around pieces of content. There's an opening tag and a closing tag. You can tell the closing tag by the slash after the angle bracket </title> . You should also notice that the tags are nested. The <head> and <body> tag are both children of <html> , and each of those tags has their own children. We'll learn more HTML down in Activity X. For now, the thing to remember is that HTML exists to tell the computer, specifically the browser, what to do with each piece of content. Another way to say this is semantic markup . Attaching structural or semantic meaning to content is especially important because not everyone (people or computers) uses their eyes to read the Web. Using valid HTML ensures that the Web is accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability. Even if you don't go on to build websites for a living, something as simple as adding a caption to any image you publish can improve accessibility. Can you find the caption or \"alt text\" for the image on this page? Text Editors # Before we move on, there's one other important thing to understand about writing HTML. HTML documents are plain text documents. You don't write HTML in a Word doc or a Google doc, instead it's best to use a piece of software called a text editor. There are many text editors out there and it's personal preference which one you use. I like one called Sublime , but I know others use Atom or Visual Studio . Try a few out to see which one suits you. Even though the text is \"plain\", text editors have a feature called syntax highlighting , which means that the text changes color to help you write good code. When it's time to see what your markup or code can do, you'll need to open it in your browser. CSS # Our next building block of the web is CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. We just learned that HTML will add structure to your document, but you need something else to add the pretty colors and images, also known as style . A style sheet is a plain text document that lists all the styles that you want to apply to your page. The cascading part means that you can be selective about how elements appear. If you analyze this page, what styles would you guess are in play? Are there some elements that look different than other elements? Cascading style sheets allow me to indicate that I want my headings to use a different font than my body text, for instance. CSS uses a different syntax than HTML. It can be a little confusing because it relies on HTML tags, but the structure is a little different. Think about HTML as a document, and CSS as a separate list. Here's an example: body { background-color: aquamarine; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; } h1 { font-size: 150%; } The first step is to identify the HTML tag you wish to style. Here, we're styling everything that lives within the <body> tag. In CSS language, this is a selector. Once we identify our selector, we list, or declare the things we want to style within a pair of curly brackets. This can be called the \"declaration block.\" We identify the thing, or \"property\" we wish to style, followed by a colon, then list the \"value\" we want to use, ending with a semi-colon. In CSS terms, it looks like this: selector { property: value; otherProperty: anotherValue; } The syntax takes getting used to, but remember, you do not have to memorize every property or selector. Even experienced Web designers have to look things up. I recommend using the W3 Schools to find reliable code to copy. There's lots to love about CSS. In a relatively simple document, you can control the style of hundreds of HTML documents and ensure consistency. But you can also pinpoint one specific margin or border and change its color or add some padding. One final note: to ensure that your CSS actually appears on your page, you need to add a piece of code to your HTML document that references the CSS document. We'll do this in Activity X. Your domain # There are many reasons you might want your own website. Whether it's for work, school, volunteering, organizing, art, or just for fun, there are plenty of ways to carve out your own corner of the Web. Social media platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook are ubiquitous now, but it used to be that if you wanted to appear in search results, you had to create your own website. If you are a student or navigating the professional world, chances are that 1) someone out there might Google you and 2) you want them to see accurate information and work that you're proud of. A professional website can be a simple single page with limited information, or it can contain your whole life. Chances are, at some point you've relied on information from a personal website. Maybe you found an article you need for a bibliography, a snippet of code that had been giving you trouble, or even an email address for someone who has lost their wallet. If you're conducting research in a field, there are others who might be interested in the work you're doing. Check out the sites of others in your intended field of study to see what their websites look like. Some scholars share articles they've written, code libraries, data they've gathered, or new methods they're experimenting with. In the Digital Humanities, a field where many humanists work with data, open and public scholarship is highly valued. Many of the links in this coursebook go to the websites of DH-ers who have been generous to share a tutorial or write up their thoughts on a particular method. Whether you create a professional portfolio or not, there is a lot to be said for the form of a Website. Most of the scholarship we read, not to mention everything else, has been designed and formatted to be consumed on the Web. Presenting your own work in that format gives you experience with seemingly silly things like getting your images to float nicely with your text or finding a place to reliably store your data. Creating a clean, well-organized website is harder than it looks! Just like it's easier to read a paragraph than to write one, creating a website takes practice. I recommend posting the exercises and projects of this coursebook to your own website. Privacy # All that being said, you do not have to have a strong presence on the Web. You may have personal and legitimate reasons for not wanting to be found in search results. If you're a student, you may not want your homework following you for decades to come. You have the right to privacy and to completing your coursework in a secure way. Reclaim Hosting # There are many places to find space on the Web, but many individuals and academic institutions work with Reclaim Hosting , an education-focused web hosting company. Reclaim offers reasonable rates, good support, and an awareness of the needs of academic projects. Some institutions offer a \"domain of one's\" program in which affiliated individuals can obtain a domain. WordPress # Activities # Activity 1: HTML # Open your favorite text editor and using the W3 Schools as a guide, write your own HTML document. Save the file as index.html in your Box folder. I'm not grading this, but it will help me troubleshoot if necessary. To view your page in the browser, open index.html in your browser, usually with the key commands Ctrl + o You should include the basic set of tags: <html> <head> <title> <body> Add seven additional types of tags to the body of your HTML document, including a table, link, and image. Add an additional HTML page and link the two pages. Activity 2: CSS # Create a separate CSS document and save it as style.css in the same folder you created for Activity 1. Link the style.css file to your HTML document. Consult the W3 Schools to figure out how to do this. Add a background color. Change the border on your table. Add style to your links when you hover over them. Activity 3: Make it live # When you opened your HTML files in your browser, you were viewing your files locally. Only you could see them on your computer. Now it's time to upload them to your domain so other people can view them. Navigate to http://yourdomain.wludci.info/cpanel and login. In CPanel, open up the File Manager. Navigate to the public_html folder. Create a new folder titled activities or something similar. Upload all your HTML and CSS files. Navigate to your equivalent of www.yourdomain.com/activities . What do you see? Add a link to this URL to our shared Box folder in the website registry. Activity 4: Install WordPress # Login to the Cpanel for your domain by adding /cpanel to the end of your URL. Use the username and password sent to you by Reclaim Hosting/Jason Mickel. You should see a Wordpress icon near the top of the page. Click on it to begin installing Wordpress. Find the \"install this application\" button. Work through the installation. You can leave the default settings except for the following: Directory - since you might want to use this domain for other things, let's put course materials in a subdirectory, such as http://www.mydomain.info/dci102 . Change the administrator username and password to something you are likely to remember. Customize the website title and tagline. Press install to finish up. You should now be able to access your wordpress admin interface by appending /wp-admin to your selected URL. Add your website address to the class Box folder DCI102-F19-data > Website Registry.boxnote Activity 5: Customize WordPress # Change your theme by going to Appearance > Themes . Select an installed theme, or find a new one with the Add New button. Activate multiple themes to try them out! Check your comment settings in Settings > Discussion to make sure your classmates will be able to comment on your posts. Set up your menu (remember we'll have 3 units with similar assignments) by going to Appearance > Menus . You will need to create a menu, add pages to it, and select a location for that menu. This is usually the most confusing part of Wordpress! Before you start adding content to your site, play around with as many of the settings and features as possible. What do all the bells and whistles do? Add your own images or colors. This is your site!

What are the humanities? What is humanities data? Why humanities data? What about digital humanities (DH)? Readings What is data? # What do you see in you mind's eye when someone says \"data?\" Data is one of those ubiquitous words that we use and see everywhere, but when it comes time to define it, we hesitate. It is used by so many people in so many contexts, it can be difficult to narrow down. If asked to share the first thing that comes to mind, you might say \"information,\" \"numbers,\" or \"facts.\" Often, data is defined by the verbs associated with it, such as this definition from Wikpedia: \"Data is measured, collected and reported, and analyzed, whereupon it can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools. Data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing.\" - Wikipedia Data is understood as something we do something with. It is an object in motion, under manipulation. It is used to say something, to prove something, or to disprove something else. Data is supposed to hold the truth. \"What does the data say?\" is a common refrain, as if data on its own can hold the answers. There is a lot more to say about the role and rhetoric of data in our society, but that does not bring us closer to a definition. If we're looking for a simple way to understand data, try this: \"Data is a value assigned to a thing.\" - School of Data . A value assigned to a thing. Value is a word we encounter a lot when working with technology and math. It is often a number, but it does not have to be. If you're filling out a form that asks for your name, email address, and phone number, the values are pieces of information that you contribute. The things are the categories, the labels that remain constant no matter how many people fill out the form. Data can be expressed in many different ways, something we'll talk about in another section. But for now, if you need a visualization, think of a simple table. Thing1 Thing2 Value 1 Value 2 What are the humanities? # The humanities might be a little easier to define than data. Wikipedia says that the humanities \"academic disciplines that study human culture.\" How does your own university define the humanities? At my school, the humanities course designation is defined this way: \"Courses in a variety of disciplines focus on aspects of human experience and on methods of addressing the basic questions of meaning in humanistic study. Courses in history, philosophy, religion, or other departments or interdepartmental programs may fulfill this requirement. W&L Registrar Now might be a good time to do some research about the history of universities and how we ended up with the academic disciplines we have. Take a look at the first few pages of Chapter 1 in Digital_Humanities . Did anything surprise you? What questions might you have about your own discipline, if you have one? But the registrar's definition offers something else: humanities courses focus on \"methods of addressing the basic questions of meaning in humanistic study.\" You might also see this phrased as \"humanistic inquiry.\" Does \"humanistic\" just mean that it is coming from a humanities discipline? Or is there more to it? If we were to borrow a computing term, using the term in its own definition is a bit recursive . Let's turn to some other potential definitions: \"The spectrum of humanistic thought, like that of scientific investigation, encompasses the gamut of beliefs regarding the nature of knowledge, the world, and the human ability to establish understanding with various degrees of certainty. D_H \"Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural representation of pre-existing fact.\" Joanna Drucker Both of these definitions give us an idea of what the humanities might be after: knowledge. The nature, meaning, and construction of knowledge. And right away, we should notice that knowledge is not a certain, natural thing. We might say that each of the humanities disciplines takes its own approach to finding meaning and constructing knowledge about the human experience. How does Philosophy do this? English? History? What is humanities data? # Miriam Poser, a name you'll see repeatedly in this coursebook, calls humanities data a \"necessary contradiction.\" She describes the humanities scholar's resistance to seeing their sources/material/texts as data. You might have a professor who thinks this way. Many humanities scholars engage with the objects of their study in a way that does require spreadsheets, databases, or powerful computers. They might read their print books, visit archives to read printed documents, or view artwork in person. That being said, many humanities scholars do, and have for a long time, used technology to help them in their work. Scholars were using computers in the 1950s to create concordances and indices . Today, scholars are reading e-books, annotating on their iPads, organizing and tagging digital images , or searching scholarly databases. In doing so, they're relying on tools and processes built by librarians, who have been organizing information for a long time. As technology expands into every corner of our lives, humanities scholars find themselves wanting and needing to address their questions, aka their lines of humanistic inquiry, in new ways. In some cases, humanities scholars have led the way in building new tools and methods for analyzing data. Examples. But what humanities scholars have found is that their \"data\" does not always make good data. We'll learn later on about tidy, well-structured data sets, but humanities sources do not fit the bill. Humanities-based research objects could be: a single book, a set of unique, hand-written manuscripts stored in four different libraries, the art on the walls of a whole city, ancient graffiti etched into crumbling plaster, or audiovisual material so fragile that it degrades with every viewing. Humanities scholars might have questions that start with, \"how many\" or \"what percentage,\" but they see years of work ahead in order to answer those questions. It's true that there are some humanities data projects that could go on for years and years. But before we get going, we have to figure out where we're going and how we're going to get there. This is a crucial piece called data modeling and it actually takes up a large portion of the work of a humanities data project. Before we start typing into our Google doc, we need to create a model of exactly what we're collecting, how it is going to be formatted, and the most difficult: what information we don't care about. For some, this is an excruciating process. Every detail is interesting, worth a whole day of rabbit trails and research. For others, it brings immense satisfaction to organize their material into neat rows and columns. Regardless it's necessary to bring your goals, data, and analysis methods in sync with one another. Fortunately, you don't have to do it alone. Humanities scholars have a reputation for working in isolation. Thinking, reading, and writing are solo activities. But data-driven humanities projects often require a team of people with a range of skillsets. Humanities scholars partner with librarians, technologists, amongst others in order to build giant databases or interactive applications. And importantly, they collaborate to extend and share their data. As just one example, the Pelagios Network lists dozens of partners in their expansive goal to \"link and explore the history of places.\" Why humanities data? # Why is this coursebook about data in the humanities and not just data in general? What about the social sciences? Or journalism? Aren't some of these methods used in the sciences as well? What if I'm not going to be a professor, why should I care? Good questions! First, there are a lot of existing resources for folks in other fields looking to learn about working with data. Examples. There are not as many resources available for folks, especially students, looking to learn about working with humanities data. This coursebook aims to fill this gap, and to do so from an multi-disciplinary perspective. But the better answer is that there are valuable lessons and transferable skills to be learned from working with humanities data. The skills, things like data modeling, cleaning, visualization, and analysis can be used in all sort of other ways. Data and databases are present in virtually every industry. Beyond technical skills, working with humanities data show you how to apply that humanistic inquiry to technology. It helps you see how the complexities of our world may have been sliced or squished to fit into a database. Understanding the principles of design will help recognize a misleading data visualization. What about digital humanities (DH)? # As you work through this coursebook, you will find references to \"Digital Humanities\" or DH. A lot of energy has been put into coming up with definitions for the Digital Humanities, but the short version is: it's the intersection of the humanities and technology. It's an umbrella term created to help humanists understand what their disciplines look like in a technological world. It's a community of practice that values process, openness, and experimentation. Humanities data projects certainly fall within Digital Humanities, but not every DH project is a humanities project. At its worst, it's a gatekeeping term, used to weaken the confidence of those who aren't sure their work is DH enough. Some people believe that in the future, DH will just be the humanities, but until then, we have this label to organize around.

Do you really know your computer? Command Line How it works Syntax File Structures Activities Activity 1 Activity 2 Activity 3 Resources https://xkcd.com/934/ Do you really know your computer? # For many of us, computers are a means to an end, a tool for a job. We use our computers to write papers, send email, talk to our friends and family, watch Netflix, or maybe play a game. Maybe you use your computer to make art, do science, or analyze statistics. Most likely, you have a preference for a PC or a Mac, even if the only reason you can articulate is the way it looks. But how well do you really know your computer? Do you know what operating system it runs? Which version of that operating system? When was the last time you updated it? Have you ever upgraded your hardware? Do you even know which pieces of your computer are the hardware? As an exercise, see if you can find the name and version of your operating system. What other information can you find out? For a device as ubiquitous as the computer, most of us don't know a lot about how they work. On the one hand, that's great! Why should you have to learn the intricacies of bits, bytes, circuits, and microprocessors to do something basic like write an email? On the other hand, what if you want to use the power of your computer to count words, make a map, or analyze a network? When it comes to working with data, having a deeper understanding of what your computer can do can be to your advantage. Not everything can be done in the browser. After all, computers started their life as counting machines. If you want to work with large sets of data in an efficient manner, ask a computer to do what it is best at: count things, find patterns, or carry out a series of operations. That is not to say computers can do all the work! Humans have their own part to play. Someone has to give the instructions, write the programs, make connections, or see the larger context of the computer's work. In this section, we'll learn about one specific way to give instructions to your computer: the command line. Command Line # Most of us interact with our computers or phones through highly visual interfaces. We know what button to press because of the stylized image representing it. We understand what it means when a website has a blue \"f\" or when a friend sends a thumbs-up emoji. Your computer, regardless of operating system, wants to interact with you via visual cues. We call these Graphical User Interfaces aka GUI (pronounced gooey). But there's another way. You can interact with your computer entirely via text commands through something called a Command Line Interface or CLI. When you see a hacker typing green text into a black box in a movie, they're using the command line. But the command line isn't just for hacking. Not only can you perform a number of different actions on your computer, many pieces of software can only be used through the command line. You can use the command line to create, move, or copy files. You can convert images or find and replace. You can run complex programming languages, or just write a simple script to automate a repetitive task. There are many tools for working with data that require you to use the command line. Just like HTML and CSS, you do not have to memorize every command. There are plenty of sites to remind you of the commands or that provide existing scripts to help with a task. How it works # For Mac users: Search and open ( Command + Space ) for an app called Terminal. A white box should appear. You should see some information about you computer, then your name, then a dollar sign. It could look like this 38371-Lib-Brooks:~ mackenzie$ . Typing in this program is a little different than typing in a document. You cannot use your mouse to click into text and change what is written. Pretend you're working at an old school computer where there is no mouse. If you want to change what you've written, use the arrow keys or backspace to navigate. Type in the letters pwd . No spaces, no capitalization. Hit enter. This command stands for \"print working directory\" and tell us where we are in the file structure. Confused yet? Scroll down to the next section for more context. For Windows users: * Search/open a program called cmd.exe or Powershell. If you're using a Chromebook, or another device, you may not be able to participate in the command line activities, since the nature of your device limits access to your computer. Syntax # Just as we learned the unique syntaxes for HTML and CSS, issuing commands in the command line requires a new syntax. Here's the basic format: $ command parameters -flag The $ is not something you type. It appears at the command prompt as a way to indicate that you should begin typing. Most tutorials you see will start their commands with the $ to show that this is the beginning of a command. Think of it like a period at the end of a sentence. It is there to visually prompt you. The next part of the syntax is the command. Usually this is a single word or series of letters, like pwd ls or cd . Go ahead and type one of these commands into the command prompt, then press enter. Next, we have parameters, or some kind of direction for our command. The command cd stands for \"change directory.\" Often, we need to tell the command prompt where we want to change into, so we need to give it a parameter. The command cd Desktop would change our directory (more about directories in a moment) to the Desktop. So in this case, Desktop = parameter. Finally, we have a flag, usually expressed as a dash + letter -f . Flags are options that you might turn on to change the nature of your command. Enter ls -l into the command prompt and press enter. ls stands for list directory contents, and in this case, the -l flag means list the contents in the long version. Now try just ls without the flag. Notice the difference? File Structures # Before we go any further, there is a key concept you must understand about how your computer stores information. All of the stuff on your computer, the documents, music, PDFs, videos, is organized into folders (also known as directories). Modern operating systems, especially on a Mac, as well as cloud-based storage like Google Drive or Box, obscure this fact. But it's essential to understanding the command line, working with data, and publishing content to the web. When you are issuing a command, or referencing a file, in any type of coding context, that action is being done with an awareness of the file structure, even if you personally don't realize it. For example, when you wanted to insert a photo of a cute kitten into your webpage, the only way to make it work was if the image of the kitten was in the same folder as your HTML document. When you wrote <img src=\"kittens.jpg\"> you were giving the browser both the name of that file, as well as the path. If both the image and the HTML document were in the same folder, then the path was unnecessary. But say you created a folder for all your images, called \"images,\" within the same folder as your HTML document. Now, your HTML might need to look like this <img src=\"/images/kittens.jgp\"> . As humans, we rely on search functions frequently to deliver the files we're looking for. But code, as expressed through commands or HTML, doesn't have a built-in search function. And even if it did, it still might not know exactly which file you meant. You have to help the computer find its way to the file you are referring to. If you recall from the previous section, websites are just made up of files and folders too. When you upload something to Web, it is being added to a folder on someone else's server. Have you ever looked at a URL up close? Some browsers, like Safari, will try to hide it from you. But if look closely, you should see the directory structure at work. In this URL, \"faculty-and-staff\" is a subdirectory of \"english-department\" https://my.wlu.edu/english-department/faculty-and-staff . If you're looking real close, you might also notice that there are dashes in the folder/directory names. This is another important lesson! Browsers and computers have a hard time with spaces. It doesn't necessary behave the same way a character like a letter or a number does. Browsers will often replace a space with the characters %20 . It's best practice to avoid using spaces in your file names. I know your computer lets you name things with spaces, but it will save you a lot of headaches if you avoid them. Use dashes, underscores, or something called camelCase where the second word is capitalized to set it apart. Activities # There are a lot of existing tutorials for learning the command line, so we're not going to try to recreate that here. Activity 1 # Work through The Command Line Crash Course . This tutorial accommodates both Windows and Mac people. This tutorial is about brute force repetition, so just lean into that method of learning for right now. Activity 2 # The Programming Historian is a wonderful website offering tutorials (in multiple languages!) on digital research methods in the humanities. They have two tutorials on the command line that are slightly more advanced than Activity 1. Work through the relevant tutorial for your operating system. Mac users: Intro to the Bash Command Line](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash) Windows users: Intro to Powershell (This one gets pretty advanced, don't worry if you can't get all the way through.) Activity 3 # In this activity, we'll apply our new command line skills to working with a corpus of textual data. While we're not quite ready to learn about text analysis, when we get there, we will need to have our data ready. You might notice I just threw some new words at you - \"corpus\" and \"textual.\" Don't freak out, these are just specific words to refer a collection (corpus) of textual (not numbers) data. Instead of a spreadsheet with rows and columns, we'll be working with individual documents groups together into folders. I am purposely giving you a kind of messy, but very much real, dataset to explore. It's okay if you get confused, but try to use these new commands Download this zip file and save it to your Desktop. Unzip the file by double clicking or using an Extract All option. A zip file is a compression method for bundling up a lot of folders into one so it's easy to share. Open the command line shell, and navigate to the folder you just downloaded. Use pwd cd and ls to navigate through the TesseractOCR folder. Can you mirror these action using your mouse and the Finder/Windows Explorer window? What are the differences? In a new document, answer the following questions: What is the basic file structure of the data set as you have received it? What about the file names? * What are the patterns? Where (or when) do the patterns change? What is the granularity (of the text files? Does each file contain one page? Issue? Reel? Volume? Year? Use cat to read a file. Find the manual for cat.

We use our computers to write papers, send email, talk to our friends and family, watch Netflix, or maybe play a game. Maybe you use your computer to make art, do science, or analyze statistics. Most likely, you have a preference for a PC or a Mac, even if the only reason you can articulate is the way it looks. But how well do you really know your computer? Do you know what operating system it runs? Which version of that operating system? When was the last time you updated it? Have you ever upgraded your hardware? Do you even know which pieces of your computer are the hardware? As an exercise, see if you can find the name and version of your operating system. What other information can you find out? For a device as ubiquitous as the computer, most of us don't know a lot about how they work. On the one hand, that's great! Why should you have to learn the intricacies of bits, bytes, circuits, and microprocessors to do something basic like write an email? On the other hand, what if you want to use the power of your computer to count words, make a map, or analyze a network? When it comes to working with data, having a deeper understanding of what your computer can do can be to your advantage. Not everything can be done in the browser. After all, computers started their life as counting machines. If you want to work with large sets of data in an efficient manner, ask a computer to do what it is best at: count things, find patterns, or carry out a series of operations. That is not to say computers can do all the work! Humans have their own part to play. Someone has to give the instructions, write the programs, make connections, or see the larger context of the computer's work. In this section, we'll learn about one specific way to give instructions to your computer: the command line.","title":"Do you really know your computer?"},{"location":"your-computer/#command-line","text":"Most of us interact with our computers or phones through highly visual interfaces. We know what button to press because of the stylized image representing it. We understand what it means when a website has a blue \"f\" or when a friend sends a thumbs-up emoji. Your computer, regardless of operating system, wants to interact with you via visual cues. We call these Graphical User Interfaces aka GUI (pronounced gooey). But there's another way. You can interact with your computer entirely via text commands through something called a Command Line Interface or CLI. When you see a hacker typing green text into a black box in a movie, they're using the command line. But the command line isn't just for hacking. Not only can you perform a number of different actions on your computer, many pieces of software can only be used through the command line. You can use the command line to create, move, or copy files. You can convert images or find and replace. You can run complex programming languages, or just write a simple script to automate a repetitive task. There are many tools for working with data that require you to use the command line. Just like HTML and CSS, you do not have to memorize every command. There are plenty of sites to remind you of the commands or that provide existing scripts to help with a task.","title":"Command Line"},{"location":"your-computer/#how-it-works","text":"For Mac users: Search and open ( Command + Space ) for an app called Terminal. A white box should appear. You should see some information about you computer, then your name, then a dollar sign. It could look like this 38371-Lib-Brooks:~ mackenzie$ . Typing in this program is a little different than typing in a document. You cannot use your mouse to click into text and change what is written. Pretend you're working at an old school computer where there is no mouse. If you want to change what you've written, use the arrow keys or backspace to navigate. Type in the letters pwd . No spaces, no capitalization. Hit enter. This command stands for \"print working directory\" and tell us where we are in the file structure. Confused yet? Scroll down to the next section for more context. For Windows users: * Search/open a program called cmd.exe or Powershell. If you're using a Chromebook, or another device, you may not be able to participate in the command line activities, since the nature of your device limits access to your computer.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"your-computer/#syntax","text":"Just as we learned the unique syntaxes for HTML and CSS, issuing commands in the command line requires a new syntax. Here's the basic format: $ command parameters -flag The $ is not something you type. It appears at the command prompt as a way to indicate that you should begin typing. Most tutorials you see will start their commands with the $ to show that this is the beginning of a command. Think of it like a period at the end of a sentence. It is there to visually prompt you. The next part of the syntax is the command. Usually this is a single word or series of letters, like pwd ls or cd . Go ahead and type one of these commands into the command prompt, then press enter. Next, we have parameters, or some kind of direction for our command. The command cd stands for \"change directory.\" Often, we need to tell the command prompt where we want to change into, so we need to give it a parameter. The command cd Desktop would change our directory (more about directories in a moment) to the Desktop. So in this case, Desktop = parameter. Finally, we have a flag, usually expressed as a dash + letter -f . Flags are options that you might turn on to change the nature of your command. Enter ls -l into the command prompt and press enter. ls stands for list directory contents, and in this case, the -l flag means list the contents in the long version. Now try just ls without the flag.
