## Specifications Grading
The assignment and grading structure for this course might be a little different than what you're used to. In this course, we'll use something called *Specifications Grading*. The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the technologies and digital methods we will be learning this term, as well as to combat grade anxiety. It is more important to me that you explore and experiment with these methods than it is that you get the "right answer." It's hard to feel comfortable experimenting and making mistakes if you're worried about every point. 

So rather than assign points or grades, I will mark each assignment as Complete/Incomplete according to a set of specifications. You must complete a certain number of assignments in each category to receive an A, B, C, etc. as listed below. You will receive three tokens to use in the case that you cannot turn in work on time or to complete an incomplete assignment. 

You will use Canvas to turn in assignments and to receive feedback. I will mark your assignments as complete/incomplete, however! Canvas will not be able to calculate your current grade with this system. You should rely on this page or this handout to help calculate your grade. 

This is a lot to get used to at first, so please ask any questions you have early in the semester. We will do a midterm check-in so you have a good understanding of where you are.

## Weekly Activities 

Each week you'll complete several activities designed to increase your familiarity with your computer, digital methods, and digital tools. Many of these activities will be started or completed together in our class sessions, but some you'll be expected to do on your own. The results will be posted to your website and detailed in each week's activity summary... 

## Blog posts 

Each week you'll write a 300-500 word blog post on your course website. Prompts will be provided in each week's activity summary. These posts will ask you to do one or more of the following: 1) reflect on what you've learned this week 2) make connections between new skills and readings or 3) get you thinking and prepared for the project.

## Humanities Data Project

In the second half of the term, you will design and conduct an independent data-driven project. 

The project will consist of five pieces: 

1. Project proposal
