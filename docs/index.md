# Humanities Data Coursebook


## What is this? 
The Humanities Data Coursebook is a set of open modules for teaching skills and methods for working with humanities-based data. Each section contains a text-based lecture, hands-on activities, assignment and assessment ideas, and further reading and resources. This coursebook grew out of a specific course, DCI 102: Data in the Humanities, taught within a minor in [Digital Culture and Information](https://my.wlu.edu/digital-culture-and-information) at Washington and Lee University. 

## Who is this for? 
The coursebook is designed for an undergraduate audience new to working with digital methods. While a background in the humanities is helpful, it is not a prerequisite. This coursebook contains methods that can be applied to a range of disciplines. The modules can be used for self-study, or taken and adapted by any instructor. 

## What are the learning goals? 

* Recognize and assess data-driven digital projects.
* Integrate research goals and digital methods with discipline-specific inquiry. 
* Develop skills necessary to create, structure, clean, manipulate, and visualize data. 
* Engage in collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based learning.
* Create professional website to document and present unit assignments. 

## How to use 
This coursebook is written in Markdown, so it can be easily adapted to a variety of other publishing platforms. Markdown is a basic syntax for writing for the Web, so the basic structure can be transformed into other formats. Specifically, this site uses a a static site generator called MKDocs along with GitHub pages. You can find the repository of Markdown files on GitHub.
