In this section, we'll walk through the process of putting together a project with humanities data.

## Picking a topic 
First things first, what do you even want to do? Big question, right? Don't worry, it's normal to feel lost at the start. You're probably at the beginning of your academic career and haven't gone through the years of training like most scholars have. You might not feel committed to one discipline or subject area yet. If that's the case, this is your chance to experiment! You can try on a topic like you try on a pair of shoes, spending a little time in them to see if they're still comfortable after walking a mile to the grocery store. For most of you, this is one assignment for one class, not something that has to follow you the rest of your life, unless you want it to. Embrace the ability to travel in your own direction. 

Some of you may be "idea people" and feel like you're brimming with potential topics already. If so, that's great! There will be a section about "scope" for you later on. If you need some help generating ideas, it can be helpful to consider these categories: 

* Objects - What thing do you want to learn more about? Is there a book, a moment in history, or an archival collection that has caught your interest? Are you interested in fanfiction about anime, 19th century detective novels, the 1918 pandemic, or perhaps some beautiful illustrated maps you saw in a museum exhibit? Some people are drawn to objects and collections, and work from there. There are lots of ways to source or generate data about objects. You might want to spend your time crafting a beautiful, if small, data set about a set of objects. 

* Questions - What questions keep you up at night? What do you ponder while you run or while you're driving? What have you wondered about while reading for your philosophy class? You might be more of an abstract thinker. How can you approach these questions in a data-driven way? You might be more interested in big approaches to data - what can learn from hundreds or thousands of texts? What patterns can you find through time and space? You should consider working with existing data sets and playing with the kinds of questions and answers you can find. 

* Skills - What do you want to get better at? Some folks are more motivated by improving their own abilities, rather than doing a deep dive into a topic. That's okay too. What skills do you want to work on? How might they transfer to another project or method? Do you want to get really good at data visualization, or maybe play with a new programming language? Or perhaps build confidence with web scraping? Go for it! You can let the software drive your decision making. We need the builders, just as much as we need the analyzers.


## Research! 
Once you have an inkling of what your topic might be, it's time to get researching. You want to get a sense of what is out there already about this topic. You want to find resources that might help with the context, but you also want to see what kind of work has already been done. Save yourself the frustration of getting halfway through a data collection project before you realize that someone has already done this work before. Getting a sense of existing approaches might also help steer you toward your approach. What do similar projects lack? How can you fill in the gaps? 

Some of you may already be flying through the internet, opening up tab after tab, making notes. But you might also find this part of the process to be paralyzing. It's a wide open world out there. Here are some tips to help you structure this important piece: 

* Structure your research process into phases. Gathering, analyzing, refining, etc. Give yourself time to explore, without deciding whether or not an article, a tutorial, a website is useful or not. You're just trying familiarize yourself with what is out there. You can use a document or something like [ZOtero]() to help. 

* Once you've done your gathering, then spend some time actually reading and considering what you've found. It is useful? Does it help you think about your topic in a new way? Did the title seem great but the content was lacking? Does an article give you a new path to explore? Try to sit with what you've found and think about it before moving on. 

* Once you have a solid sense of what is out there about your topic, it's time to refine and narrow your scope. This stage has its own challenges. It can be hard to make a decision at this stage. You feel pressure to make the right one. Don't worry, you can still pivot if you need to, but remember that there are benefits to making decisions and moving ahead now. You're probably on a deadline and need to get moving onto the next phase of the project. Consider creating a mental or physical "parking lot" for ideas or resources that you are intrigued by, but don't have time for right now. 

* You may notice that these tips are conflating the idea of your topic and the research about your topic. That's because at this stage, things are still rather fluid. You may discover that the object, question, or skill that was going to be your topic is just not tenable at this time. Or you may be researching the historical background for one thing and come across an amazing data set for another thing that changes your direction. 

Enough pep talk! Give me some real tips: 

* Start at the library. Whether it's your library's website or the physical location, browse the resources that your institution has provided for you. Talk to a librarian you know, they love to help. 

* Start local. Every town has its stories. Archives, museums, historical societies, and special collections can hold original or unique materials about the people and places nearby. In this coursebook, we've worked with data about the inhabitants of the local cemetery and the school newspaper. These local stories may not have been analyzed or shared before, but they still have relevance to larger issues. Not all small institutions have the resources to make their holdings available online, so you may have to talk to someone or get creative.

* Consider the discipline. Don't forget that scholarly work segments itself by discipline, so you may have to navigate those boundaries. Is your topic fundamentally about literature? About history? About philosophy? What other disciplines does it touch? Check out the scholarly organization for that discipline, its major journals, or research centers.

## What's my data? 

Hopefully, if you've read other sections of this coursebook, you have an idea of what humanities data *could* look like. But what will your data look like? How do you take a topic idea and turn that into data? 

1. During the research process, identify and inventory any existing data sets related to your topic. What's there? What's missing? How might you fill in a gap or take your research in a new direction?

2. Start asking questions. What do you want to know? What can you learn from this object/corpus? You don't have to have a firm research question yet, but you should be wondering things. 

3. What kind of approach do you want to take? How might that dictate the form of your data? Do you need a list of people and their attributes for network analysis? Do you want to count things and visualize patterns? Do you need place names and coordinates? 

4. Consider your limitations. What is your timeframe? What is your skill level? What data is available already and what must you create yourself? Are you working alone or in a team? Do you have access to everything you need? Are you prepared to do *a lot* of data entry, or do you know that tedious work is not your thing? 

5. Set your scope. Then make your scope a little smaller. Trust me. You can always add more later, but when you're new to this kind of work, it's best to start small. If you want to map something, do you need to map the whole country? WOuld it be better to do a region, a state, or even a county? If you're interested in text mining 19th century literature, perhaps a single genre, author, or timespan could serve as a boundary to that work? 

At this point, you should be at a place where you can write a proposal for your project. You know the types of things you want to do, the questions you want to explore, even if you don't have the answers yet. 


## Data modeling 

In the [data section](data.md), we covered the mechanics of data modeling. Here, let's cover it as part of the research and project process. Chances are, data modeling will go hand in hand with determining your specific research questions. You will need to iterate over this process a few times before you've arrived at something feasible.
