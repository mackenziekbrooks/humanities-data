In this section, we'll lay the groundwork for what we mean when we talk about "humanities data."

## What is data? 
What do you see in you mind's eye when someone says "data?"

Data is one of those ubiquitous words that we use and see everywhere, but when it comes time to define it, we hesitate. It is used by so many people in so many contexts, it can be difficult to narrow down. If asked to share the first thing that comes to mind, you might say "information," "numbers," or "facts." 

Often, data is defined by the verbs associated with it, such as this definition from Wikpedia: 


> "Data is measured, collected and reported, and analyzed, whereupon it can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools. Data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data)


Data is understood as something we do something with. It is an object in motion, under manipulation. It is  used to say something, to prove something, or to disprove something else. Data is supposed to hold the truth. "What does the data say?" is a common refrain, as if data on its own can hold the answers. There is a lot more to say about the role and rhetoric of data in our society, but that does not bring us closer to a definition. If we're looking for a simple way to understand data, try this: 


> "Data is a value assigned to a thing." - [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/what-is-data). 

A value assigned to a thing. *Value* is a word we encounter a lot when working with technology and math. It is often a number, but it does not have to be. If you're filling out a form that asks for your name, email address, and phone number, the values are pieces of information that you contribute. The *things* are the categories, the labels that remain constant no matter how many people fill out the form. 

Data can be expressed in many different ways, something we'll talk about in another section. But for now, if you need a visualization, think of a simple table. 

|Thing1|Thing2|
|---|---|
|Value 1|Value 2|



## What are the humanities?
The humanities might be a little easier to define than data. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities) says that the humanities "academic disciplines that study human culture." 

How does your own university define the humanities? At my school, the humanities course designation is defined this way: 

> "Courses in a variety of disciplines focus on aspects of human experience and on methods of addressing the basic questions of meaning in humanistic study. Courses in history, philosophy, religion, or other departments or interdepartmental programs may fulfill this requirement. [W&L Registrar](http://catalog.wlu.edu/content.php?catoid=15&navoid=1194#HU)

Now might be a good time to do some research about the history of universities and how we ended up with the academic disciplines we have. Take a look at the first few pages of [Chapter 1 in Digital_Humanities](https://dssf.musselmanlibrary.org/2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Digital_Humanities.pdf). Did anything surprise you? What questions might you have about your own discipline, if you have one? 


But the registrar's definition offers something else: humanities courses focus on "methods of addressing the basic questions of meaning in humanistic study." You might also see this phrased as "humanistic inquiry." Does "humanistic" just mean that it is coming from a humanities discipline? Or is there more to it? If we were to borrow a computing term, using the term in its own definition is a bit [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)). 

Let's turn to some other potential definitions:

> "The spectrum of humanistic thought, like that of scientific investigation, encompasses the gamut of beliefs regarding the nature of knowledge, the world, and the human ability to establish understanding with various degrees of certainty. D_H


> "Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural representation of pre-existing fact." [Joanna Drucker](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html)

Both of these definitions give us an idea of what the humanities might be after: knowledge. The nature, meaning, and construction of knowledge. And right away, we should notice that knowledge is not a certain, natural thing. We might say that each of the humanities disciplines takes its own approach to finding meaning and constructing knowledge about the human experience. How does Philosophy do this? English? History? 

## What is humanities data? 
Miriam Poser, a name you'll see repeatedly in this coursebook, [calls](https://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/) humanities data a "necessary contradiction." She describes the humanities scholar's resistance to seeing their sources/material/texts as data. You might have a professor who thinks this way. 


## Why humanities data? 
Why is this course about data in the humanities and not just data in general? What about the social sciences? Or journalism? Aren't some of these methods used in the sciences as well? 

## What about digital humanities (DH)? 

If we want to get a little more theoretical about data, we can look at what Joanna Drucker says

> "...phenomena are observer-independent and can be characterized as data. Data pass themselves off as mere descriptions of a priori conditions." 
http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html
